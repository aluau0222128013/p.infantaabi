<br>Rows of Agal vilakkus (clay oil lamps) are lit in the houses of adherents in celebration of this festival, considered to be auspicious symbols. It is believed to ward off evil forces, and usher in prosperity and joy. This festival is also celebrated to commemorate the bonding between brothers and sisters in South India (analogous to Raksha Bandhan). Sisters pray for the prosperity and success of their brothers, and light lamps to mark the occasion.
